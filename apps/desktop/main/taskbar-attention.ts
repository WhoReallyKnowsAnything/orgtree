/** THE WINDOWS TASKBAR PULSE (user ruling 2026-09-12): while any attached
 *  question, attention ticket or urgent mail is waiting, the taskbar button
 *  uses the platform's own attention behaviour — `flashFrame`, which is what
 *  every other Windows application uses to say "come back here".
 *
 *  The renderer publishes the whole qualifying IDENTITY SET on every poll
 *  rather than a boolean, because the two things this has to tell apart look
 *  identical to a boolean:
 *    · the same items seen again on the next poll — MUST NOT restart the
 *      pulse, or a five-second poll would flash the taskbar for ever;
 *    · one of several items resolving — MUST NOT clear or restart anything,
 *      because the rest are still waiting;
 *  while a genuinely NEW arrival must pulse, even though the taskbar was
 *  already "in attention" for an older item.
 *
 *  Windows cancels a flash the moment the window is activated, so `focused()`
 *  forgets that a flash is running. The known set is deliberately kept: a poll
 *  reporting the same items after the user has looked will not pulse again. */
/** macOS's equivalent of `FlashWindow`: `app.dock.bounce('critical')` returns
 *  an id used to cancel that specific bounce later. Injected the same way as
 *  `target` (not `import { app } from 'electron'` directly) - requiring the
 *  real `electron` package outside an Electron process, exactly how
 *  tests/taskbarattention.test.mjs runs this file via esbuild+plain node:test,
 *  resolves to a path string rather than `{ app }` and would break every
 *  existing test here. */
