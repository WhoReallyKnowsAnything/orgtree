 *  the app has shut down, a modal nobody can see is holding the restart, and
 *  Orgtree is gone until morning. That is the original complaint wearing a new
 *  hat, arriving through the fix for it.
 *
 *  So nothing waits. The exit records the failure and relaunches immediately,
 *  and the instance that comes back reports it — when there is a running app
 *  and, usually, a person. The record is the update log, which is already on
 *  disk and already bounded, so this survives the exit, a crash, and a reboot

  // installed nothing. No 'not-installed' was ever written, so a report keyed on
  // it would have said nothing — exactly the silence being complained about.

 *  too, so version equality never did prove the file had survived.

/** Whether Windows will quote `/D=<directory>` on the way to the installer.
 *  DIAGNOSTIC ONLY — nothing branches on it. What it records and why is below,
 *  and the "why" is the opposite of what this comment used to say.
 *
 *  NSIS wants /D= LAST and UNQUOTED. Node's spawn quotes any argument
 *  containing whitespace, so `C:\Program Files\Orgtree` reaches the installer
 *  as `"/D=C:\Program Files\Orgtree"`, and app-builder-lib's GetDParameter
 *  (templates/nsis/multiUser.nsh) scans the RAW command line for `/D=` and
 *  copies everything after it — trailing quote included — INTO ITS OWN OUTPUT
 *  VARIABLE.
 *
 *  ⚠ NOT INTO $INSTDIR, WHICH IS WHERE THIS COMMENT WAS WRONG. The template
 *  then does `StrCpy $INSTDIR $R0`, and assignment to $INSTDIR SANITISES THE
 *  VALUE AS A FILENAME: every character Windows forbids is removed. Measured
 *  against the real parser and the real makensis — 76 characters parsed, 75 in
 *  $INSTDIR, and all six of " * ? < > | stripped from a poisoned control in
 *  one run (tests/disruptive/nsis-destination.test.mjs). Both forms therefore arrive at an
 *  identical destination and a directory created from it is the intended one.
 *
 *  ⚠ WHICH MAKES THE HANDOFF ACCIDENTALLY SAFE, NOT ROBUST. The quoting is
 *  harmless only because the single character it adds happens to be one
 *  $INSTDIR forbids. A corruption made of LEGAL characters would pass straight
 *  through. Nobody has shown such a shape is reachable from installDirectory()
 *  and nobody has shown it is not; this is recorded so the measurement is never
 *  read as a clean bill of health.
 *
 *  THE HISTORY, because the old belief is in the incident record and someone
 *  will re-derive it otherwise: this comment described the mechanism as real,
 *  the handoff log warned about it on every all-users update, and the incident
 *  report from the failed 2.1.3 → 2.1.4 machine named it as the strongest
 *  candidate cause. Measurement refuted it (decision 16), so the change built
