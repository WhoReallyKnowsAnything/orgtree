 *  the compact map marker that also renders it is unreachable in v2
 *  (`isCompact()` returns a hardcoded false — mobile is out of v2 scope).
 *
 *  ⚠ EXTRACTED FROM THE CHROME ON PURPOSE, not for tidiness. As an inline
 *  IIFE inside `App` this markup could only be reached by a test that mounts
 *  the entire application, which no node test does — so when the eye's badge
 *  went, tests/urgentpip.test.tsx §6 ("the prop reaches the DOM, pulsing
 *  class and all") lost the only surface it could mount, and the pulse class
 *  would have gone untested at every surface that still renders it. A named
 *  component is mountable. Behaviour is unchanged: same classes, same title,
 *  same two-tier badge, same click.
 *
 *  The 2026-08-04 ruling was that this bell is the ONLY thing in the chrome
 *  that glows for attention; the user widened WHAT counts for it (urgent mail
 *  joined open asks) without touching that. It is no longer sole: on
 *  2026-09-11 the user asked for the `Update now` button to glow as well
 *  while a downloaded update waits, and on 2026-09-12 for the header Docket
 *  button to glow when items need attention. Authorised signals, each meaning

 *  the freeze record — deliberately, since a retired agent keeps its context
 *  and can be rehired — so the old test (`n.frozen != null` alone) counted
 *  nodes ▶ has never been willing to touch. Nothing behind the banner was
 *  broken: the backend already refused them and ▶ resumed nobody.
 *
 *  ⚠ THE RULE IS NOT HERE, AND MUST NOT COME BACK HERE. `node.resumable` is
 *  composed by the backend from `supervisor.resumable`, which is the single
 *  expression of it. The first fix re-derived the rule in this file and held
 *  the two copies together with a test that read `supervisor.py` as text —
 *  and a source-text check cannot tell a rule that got STRONGER from one that
 *  got weaker, fires on a harmless rename, and misses a semantic change that
 *  keeps the same spelling. If you find yourself adding a condition below,
 *  the condition belongs in `_resumable` instead.
 *
 *  The `frozen != null` test is a TYPE NARROWING, not a second copy of the
 *  rule: `resumable` is only ever true for a node carrying a record, and the
 *  banner dereferences `.frozen.until` — this is how TypeScript is told. */
