"""Antigravity stream-json driver, reusable across result boundaries.

Keeping stdin open permits multiple prompts in one process. Closing it
retains the one-shot mode. Native conversation ids support cold resumes.

The wire is print mode's `--output-format stream-json` — NDJSON on stdout:

    {"event":"init", "conversation_id":…, "init":{"cwd":…, "model":…,
                     "permission_mode":…, "tools":[…]}}
    {"event":"step_update", "step_update":{"step_index":n,
                     "state":"ACTIVE|DONE|ERROR",
                     "step_type":"user_input|agent_response|tool",
                     "text_delta":…, "tool_name":…, "tool_info":{…},
                     "usage":{input_tokens, output_tokens, thinking_tokens,
                              cache_read_tokens, total_tokens}}}
    {"event":"result", "result":{"conversation_id":…, "status":"SUCCESS|
                     ERROR|CANCELED", "response":…, "error":…, "usage":{…}}}

and the PROMPT rides STDIN as `--input-format stream-json` — one line,
`{"event":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":<text>}}` — then EOF,
which is what ends the run after that one turn ("stream input closed after
1 turn(s)"). Stdin, not argv: Windows caps a command line at 32K characters
and a mail batch can be longer; the stdin lane carried 120K characters of
prose intact (measured). ⚠ A single 40,000-character TOKEN (no whitespace)
made the CLI return an empty SUCCESS with zero usage — real text does not do
that, and nothing orgtree sends is a 40K-character word.

Steering uses invocation hooks: a private handoff file injects a user step,
and PostInvocation can force continuation. Delivery is committed only after
the hook emitted it and the CLI echoed a new user-input step. Late mail stays
queued. Interrupt still kills the entire process tree.

Org powers attach as a WORKSPACE PLUGIN the CLI discovers walking up from
the cwd: `<cwd>/.agents/plugins/orgtree/mcp_config.json` (measured) carries
the same `python -m orgtree.mcptool` stdio server the claude lane spawns via
--mcp-config, so the ledger enforces authority identically on every lane and
nothing is written to the user's own CLI config. ⚠ An MCP server
INHERITS every environment variable its spec does not name (measured — the
parent's ANTHROPIC_API_KEY reached the orgtree server), so `write_workspace`
names the full ORGTREE_* identity set and the spawn env is scrubbed of the
other providers' material (`providers.antigravity_env`).

⚠ THE MODEL PIN IS ASSERTED, NOT ASSUMED. An id the CLI's registry does not
know fails the run LOUDLY (rc=1, `result.status == "ERROR"`, the registry
listed — measured, unlike the previous Google lane which substituted its
default silently), and the `init` event echoes the base id actually
serving the session; the turn fails on any mismatch as a belt.

⚠ PERMISSIONS: headless print mode CANNOT prompt, so in its default
review mode every command, write and MCP call is auto-denied and the run
ends with "no output produced" (measured — an agent with no org powers).
Every orgtree turn therefore runs `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, and a
node whose ⚙ scope narrows `bash`/`edit` is held to it by a PreToolUse HOOK
(`<cwd>/.agents/hooks.json`, measured: {"decision":"deny"} blocks the call
and the run CONTINUES with the reason shown to the model; a hook that fails
to run blocks the call too — fail closed). The hook command is a wrapper
script taking NO arguments, and on Windows its path is emitted with NO
QUOTES AND NO SPACES — see `_hook_command`, which carries the measurement.
A quote of ours is fatal: the CLI is a Go binary, so `syscall.EscapeArg`
backslash-escapes it on the way to `cmd`, and every tool call on that seat
then dies before it runs (live, 2026-09-11).

⚠ THE CWD IS NOT THE WORKSPACE unless `--add-dir <cwd>` says so: without it
the agent's tools ran in the CLI's own app-data scratch (measured),
so the flag is unconditional.

⚠ CREDENTIALS: this module never reads, copies or moves auth material. The
CLI self-authenticates from the OS keyring; a missing login fails the turn
with the CLI's own error.

Hermetic by construction: everything is parameterized (argv head, cwd,
hooks), so tests drive it against backend/tests/fakeantigravity.py instead
of the real CLI — see backend/tests/test_antigravityrun.py.

    ⚠ NOTHING BEST-EFFORT COMES OUT OF HERE. A token cmd re-splits or expands
    does not merely fail to find the hook: `…\\Orgtree v2\\…` runs
    `…\\Orgtree` and hands it `v2\\…`, so a stray `Orgtree.exe` beside the
    data root would be EXECUTED, and `%VAR%` pastes the environment into the
    command line. Where no expressible shape exists this RAISES and the turn
